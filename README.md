# Hunting and Fishing Store

Welcome to the **Hunting and Fishing Store** repository! This project provides a backend platform for managing products, categories, and functionalities related to a store specializing in hunting and fishing items.

## Features

- **Product Management**: Create, update, and delete inventory items.
- **Categories**: Organize products by categories such as weapons, bait, clothing, and more.
- **User Authentication**: Access control with login and registration.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Java
- **Other Tools**: [Additional APIs or libraries, e.g., Stripe for payments]

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This project heavily utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java to ensure a modular, reusable, and maintainable codebase. Key OOP concepts applied include:

- **Encapsulation**: Ensuring that data is accessed only through defined methods, enhancing security and code clarity.
- **Inheritance**: Promoting code reuse by creating base classes for shared behaviors and extending them for specific functionalities.
- **Polymorphism**: Allowing flexibility and scalability by using interfaces and overriding methods.
- **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex logic by focusing on essential features and hiding implementation details.

The use of OOP in Java provides a structured approach to building the backend, ensuring it is scalable and easy to maintain.

## Exception Handling

The project includes robust exception handling mechanisms to ensure the backend is resilient and provides meaningful feedback in case of errors. Key aspects of exception handling in this project include:

- **Custom Exceptions**: Specific exceptions are created to handle domain-specific errors, ensuring clarity and maintainability.
- **Try-Catch Blocks**: Critical operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks to gracefully handle runtime errors and prevent system crashes.
- **Logging**: All exceptions are logged with meaningful messages to aid in debugging and monitoring.
- **Validation Errors**: Input validation is enforced, and appropriate exceptions are thrown when invalid data is detected.

This approach ensures that the application remains stable, secure, and user-friendly, even in the presence of unexpected conditions.
