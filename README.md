## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This project heavily utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java to ensure a modular, reusable, and maintainable codebase. Key OOP concepts applied include:

- **Encapsulation**: Ensuring that data is accessed only through defined methods, enhancing security and code clarity.
- **Inheritance**: Promoting code reuse by creating base classes for shared behaviors and extending them for specific functionalities.
- **Polymorphism**: Allowing flexibility and scalability by using interfaces and overriding methods.
- **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex logic by focusing on essential features and hiding implementation details.

The use of OOP in Java provides a structured approach to building the backend, ensuring it is scalable and easy to maintain.
